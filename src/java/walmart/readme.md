### To Check For Balanced Brackets In An Expression (Well-Formedness) Using Stack
#### CheckForBalancedBrackets.class
Given an expression string exp, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“, “}”, “(“, “)”, “[“, “]” are correct in exp.

Example:

Input: exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}”
Output: Balanced

Input: exp = “[(])”
Output: Not Balanced 

### Reverse of LinkedList
#### _ReverseLinkedList.class - reverse with additional Node structure_
#### _ReverseJavaLinkedList - revers with Java LinkedList structure_

### Find second highest element in Array
#### _ArrayFindSecondHighestElement.class_

### Customized Stack implementation with getMin() function with constant time complexity.
#### _StackWithGetMinFunction.class_
Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull()
and an additional operation getMin() which should return minimum element from the SpecialStack.
All these operations of SpecialStack must be O(1).
To implement SpecialStack, you should only use standard Stack data structure and no other data structure like arrays, list, .. etc
The interesting part is, how to handle the case when minimum element is removed.
